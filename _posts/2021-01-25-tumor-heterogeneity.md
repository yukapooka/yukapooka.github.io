## Short Summary
This was my first PhD project where I studied the spatial mutational heterogeneity of 4 colorectal cancer patients to understand the aggressiveness of their disease. I analyzed the targeted sequencing datasets of 24 biopsy samples taken from different parts of the tumors, identified DNA mutations and constructed phylogeny trees to understand how the patient's tumors have evolved. I also performed statistical analyses to highlight genes that are mutated and exhibit correlated changes in their gene activities using gene expression datasets profiled from the same samples.

This study was published in the Molecular Oncology journal:
