Git is a powerful versioning tool allowing you to share code with your team. It lets you sandbox your work in a dedicated space called **branches**. How you manage branches is up to you. What matters is: how do you glue all those branches together when the delivery time comes.

[Vincent Driessen](https://medium.com/u/e734b7ff7b76?source=post_page-----2570b390bfb2----------------------) presented ten years ago Git Flow. Since then, many developers have adopted it. So massively, that he recently wrote a note in his original post. He thought valuable to urge developers to consider this workflow only if you must deal with several versions in production.

If you fit into that category, I still consider Git Flow to be the most reliable workflow.

So to celebrate its tenth anniversary, I’ll dedicate this article to this workflow. I’ll explain as simply as possible how to respect its philosophy.

# The Core Branches

When you create a Git repository, it comes along with a `master` branch. That's your most sensitive branch ever. It's a snapshot of what you deliver in production.

To move forward between two releases, you must create a `develop` branch. That's where you'll pour all your ongoing work. You must never merge directly into `master`.

So to begin with, create and switch to the `develop` branch. Let's commit once for illustration purpose:

```
$ git checkout -b develop
$ git commit -am "First commit on develop"
$ git push -u origin develop
```

> The -u option while pushing is only required the first time you push your branch to the remote repository.

# Brew Your Next Release

During your project’s lifecycle, you’ll develop features to improve your product. Each time you’ll start one, create a branch prefixed with feature/ from `develop`.

```
$ git checkout develop
$ git checkout -b feature/my_awesome_feature
```

You’ll want to commit your work and push it to the remote branch.

```
$ git commit -am "My awesome commit message"
$ git push -u origin feature/my_awesome_branch
```

![my_awesome_branch starts from develop and has one commit](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*PSO57OC9qVbovKDukO0e0A.png)

When you’ve finished your feature, create a Pull Request on GitHub targeting `develop`. Make sure your branch is mergeable. If not, I encourage you to rebase your branch on `develop`. It's not as difficult as some people say, simply follow these steps described in ["Don't Fret With Git Rebase"](https://medium.com/better-programming/dont-fret-with-git-rebase-75fe3ed5ca8f).

![Pull Request from GitHub web interface](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*7OWAn84RL-ctCG_6LF0CGA.png)

Finally, merge your branch when both your teammates and your CI allows it.

If you don’t use the GitHub interface to merge your branch, you can always do it from the CLI.

```
$ git checkout develop
$ git merge --no-ff origin feature/my_awesome_branch
```

> By default, GitHub does a `merge --no-ff`. See the documentation for more information.

![develop has moved forward from master](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*nPSkPt5weuRM1QH-tKNo-w.png)

Update your remote `develop` branch and do some cleanup

```
$ git push origin develop
$ git branch -D feature/my_awesome_branch
$ git push -d origin feature/my_awesome_branch
```

> The last line is optional if you’ve merged from a Pull Request as you can delete your remote branch from there.

The official documentation only mentions `feature` as supporting branch to `develop`. Yet, we cannot summarize a project's lifecycle to features. You'll need to address tasks, fix bugs arising from new features, and so on.

Depending on your organization, you should have a branch naming policy. For instance, you could name them `bugfix` or `task`. If you'd like to enforce such a policy, have a look at ["How to Prevent Git Commit Naming Mistakes"](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-prevent-git-commit-naming-mistakes-a34c8a7c6ae6).

# Prepare Your Release

Getting ready to ship a new version? Create a `release` branch from `develop` since that's your most up-to-date branch. Name it with the version name — let's say `2.0.0`.

> Prefer naming with the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH pattern. We’ll see why later.

Here is the branch you’ll create:

```
$ git checkout develop
$ git checkout -b release/v2.0.0
```

Remember to bump your version in your code and commit this change:

```
$ git commit -am "Bump version to 2.0.0"
```

Note that the `release` branch should only contain `bugfix` branches. You don't want to deliver a new feature while you're about to ship a new version.

With a merged `bugfix` branch on `release`, you should have the following tree:

![bugfix was merged into release](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*vAzBxWJCIzq_4ee4xpzQ_Q.png)

---

# Finish Your Release

As soon as you ship the release to your users, you can merge your `release` branch into `master`. Either create a Pull request targeting `master` or do it on the CLI

```
$ git checkout master
$ git merge --no-ff origin release/v2.0.0
```

Then mark it with a tag `v2.0.0` on `master`.

```
$ git tag v2.0.0
$ git push --tags
```

![Merging the release into master](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*F3FLDOfSNskgClqYjVRXeg.png)

Now before deleting your `release` branch, you must merge all the bugs you've fixed into `develop`. First, merge `develop` into `release` to solve your potential conflicts.

```
$ git checkout release/v2.0.0
$ git merge --no-ff origin develop
```

Once your conflicts solved, you can open a Pull Request to merge release into `develop`.

In the official Git Flow guide, the back merge is directly performed from `develop`. I'd recommend doing the extra steps above for two reasons:

1. You should never push directly to `develop`
2. It’s always beneficial to assess the back merge’s correctness from a Pull Request. You’ll want a set of eyes to prevent mistakes.

![Merging release into develop to retrieve your bugfixes](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*t0cSSgBNhQ_WbCBTj_Ne3g.png)

Finally, do the cleanup.

```
$ git branch -D release/v2.0.0
$ git push -d origin release/v2.0.0
```

Now that you have deployed your release, you can carry on with your product and get ready with the next release.

# Patch Your Release

Let’s face it; your application will suffer from bugs in production. Sometimes, some are too critical to wait for the next release.

You’ll need to react fast and deliver an unexpected release that fixes the issue. Create a `hotfix` branch from `master`. Let's name it `2.0.1` by using the PATCH number I mentioned above.

After that, you’ll do the same you did for a `release` branch:

1. Merge `hotfix` into `master`
2. Tag your `hotfix`
3. Merge `develop` into `hotfix`
4. Fix potential conflicts on `hotfix`
5. Merge `hotfix` into `develop`
6. Delete `hotfix`

With these steps, you have the complete tree you could get:

# Thoughts About Git Flow

Git Flow provides a battle-tested workflow. If you follow those principles, you’ll iterate fast without hurdles.

Thanks for reading and happy anniversary to Git Flow!
